                                            <p>As mentioned above, the investment must be for a five-year period, and the investment agreement must be concluded through a middleman who can participate in the QIIP.  </p>
                                            <p>The investment of CAD $1.2 million is guaranteed. It means that the Quebec government will reimburse its complete amount after five years.</p>
