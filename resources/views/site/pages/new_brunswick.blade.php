                                			<p>New Brunswick, along with Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, is considered the Atlantic province of Canada. It was from these seaside regions that the development and colonization of the region began long ago. The first Europeans appeared here in the XV century - they were Basque fishermen. Then, in 1534, the expedition of Jacques Cartier, studying the Atlantic coast of Canada, approached the eastern coast of New Brunswick.</p>
                                            <p>And, finally, the first colony was established in 1604 by the French, who arrived with de Champlain. Thus New France was born. Throughout the century, with varying success, the British and French fought for this land, indigenous people involved in the conflict - the tribes of the Mikmakov, Abenaki and Beothuk. In this confrontation, according to the peace treaty of 1713 England received Acadia.</p>

                                            <p>The eastern territory of New Brunswick, washed by the ocean, adjoins the Island of Prince Edward - the famous Confederate bridge erected over the Northumberland Strait, provides a link between the two provinces. In the north and center of New Brunswick, the spurs of the Appalachians rise, in the southeast lowlands dominate, and the south is decorated with Caledonian hills framing the picturesque Bay of Fundy - one of the best national parks of the continent.</p>

                                            <p>A significant part of New Brunswick is occupied by rivers and lakes. The local landscapes are so beautiful that this Canadian province is called a "picture". The region's economy is also largely based on inland water resources - water bodies and rivers are full of fish: sturgeon, trout, perch, salmon, herring, roach and many other species. The largest river of the province is St. John, its basin covers about half of the entire territory, and the most important cities are situated on its shores: Edmondson, St. John and the capital Fredericton. In addition, there are many small towns and villages.

                                            <p>According to Canadian Law, all provinces and territories provide universal, publicly funded health care to all citizens and legal residents of Canada. In other words, most basic health services are available to the patient at no cost.  Certain procedures that are not considered necessary (such as cosmetic surgery and a number of dental care procedures) are generally not covered, but the list of free services differ from province to province. New Brunswick Medicare covers most medically required services, which is provided by medical practitioners. In addition to Medicare, health insurance can be purchased from major private sector insurers.

                                            <p>Italian explorer John Cabot triggered great interest in Newfoundland (after traveling in 1497 on behalf of King Henry VII of England), when he described "the sea is replete with fish so that if you simply throw a basket in it, you will get it back with the fish." Cabot initiated mass resettlement in the New World, and St. Johns became the center of fishing and one of the most ancient and lively settlements. Fishing, oil exploration works are underway, ships from hundreds of countries come to the port. Residents of St. John's are known for their hospitality.
