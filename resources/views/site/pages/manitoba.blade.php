                                			<p>Manitoba is the sunniest province in Canada, with a huge number of lakes and rivers on its territory. It was because of its huge ponds that the province gained such name. There are several theories concerning the origin of the name, but all of them, more or less, are related to lakes.</p>

                                            <p>The province of Manitoba is neighboring with Nunavut and the Northwest Territories and the provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan, and also borders Minnesota and North Dakota - the northern American states. The access to the sea through the Hudson Bay played a huge role in the history and economy of the province. The seaport in Churchill provides the shortest route for cargo tankers from Europe, Russia and Asia. This contributed to the development of railroads and highways connecting Canada with the United States.</p>

                                            <p>It should also be noted that Manitoba is almost the only territory in Canada with a huge number of indigenous reservations. Many of them are involved in the political life of the country. And, of course, they serve as a center for preserving the culture and traditions of the ancient tribes. It is in this province that one can find a peculiar symbiosis of two cultures: Indian and European.

                                			<p>Transport occupies an important role in the economy of the province, but it is far from dominating. Manitoba is considered an agricultural province, providing Canada with grain and meat (pork and beef). The lack of large production facilities has a positive impact on the province's ecology, but it also results in low economic growth rates as well as the level of incomes of its population, which is about 1,200 million inhabitants.</p>

                                            <p>Manitoba is one of the few provinces where a large part of the population lives in the same city (and its suburbs). Winnipeg is the economic, political and cultural center of this agricultural province. The other largest city of Manitoba - Brandon - is young, but rapidly developing.</p>

                                            <p>In addition to agriculture in Manitoba, the most promising fields of the economy are forestry, mining industry represented by nickel mines, power stations. Tourism plays an important role in the economy, natural resources, abundance of ocean species with colorful national parks attracting a lot of people. But the main landmark that tourists are interested in is the world observation center for polar animals - beluga and polar bears.

                                            <p>There are more than a dozen universities and colleges, where you can find a suitable program, starting, from a mechanic, nurse or administrator to an engineer, a doctor, an international business specialist. The cost of training and the cost of living is lower than, for example, in Toronto. There’s flexible immigration policy and need for new migrants, especially, young professionals. But Manitoba is also one of the provinces famous for its provincial immigration program, which continues to operate successfully along with the federal program Express Entry. The province is waiting for new residents and there are many employment possibilities for future agrarians, engineers, doctors, nurses, teachers, kindergarten teachers and mechanics. And this list is far from complete.</p>

                                            <p>There are many French-speaking Canadians in Manitoba. There is a French-speaking university, French cultural centers, many good schools under the French Immersion program.

Vinnie was the favorite of the whole regiment, but when troops were camped in London, the authorities ordered to get rid of the bear, and he had to be moved to the London Zoo.</p>
