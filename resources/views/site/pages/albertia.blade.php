Due to technological advances, this sector is expected to expand. Apart from the energy industry, there’s also a manufacturing and forestry industry. Large farming and ranching are traditional industries.</p> 

                                            <p>With a steady pace of economic growth in the province, Alberta is a great place to find employment.

                                            <p> In Canada, all citizens and permanent residents under the age of 20 are entitled to free education until the end of high school through the public school system. When immigrants move to Alberta, their children can choose from several different schools, all funded by tax dollars and without fees. Apart from the main public school system, there are also francophone schools for education in French, as well as a Catholic school system. </p>

                                            <p>Alberta also has online education programs and other alternative schools available as educational options. Some people in the province send their children to private schools. The vast majority, however, use public schools, which are of high quality.</p>

                                            <p>Alberta’s publicly funded post-secondary education system has a total of 26 institutions, including four universities with a total of over 115,000 full- and part-time students.

The city is also popular for its strong British background. Annual summer rodeos are held in Bella Coola and Williams Lake. </p>

                                            <p>British Columbia is a good place to find a job in Canada.
