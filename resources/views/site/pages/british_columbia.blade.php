                                			<p>Far, far away there is a fairy-tale country which lies on the Pacific coast among the forests and rocks, where bearded bears wander in the evergreen forests, salmon splashes in the mountain rivers, grapes grow in the valleys, and where good people live. This place is called British Columbia, the most western province of Canada.</p>
                                            <p>And if you ever read Jack London, you should know where decent people hunt for gold. </p>

                                            <p>The capital of British Columbia is Victoria; the largest city is Vancouver. Ski resorts: Whistler - Blackcomb, Sun Peaks, Silver Star, Big White, Kimberley, Fernier.</p>

                                            <p>The climate of British Columbia is extremely unpredictable. The Pacific Ocean and the Arctic make their rules - therefore, those who are not used to weather changes will be slightly uncomfortable from temperature fluctuations. Although it is not too hot in summer and winter isn’t too cold. </p>

                                            <p>"Miracle" - this is how precisely springs are called all over the world. The most famous of them are Albert, Canyon, Fairmont, Nakusup, Ainsworth, Halcyon and Radium. </p>

                                            <p>The basis of the British Columbia economy is natural resources. It is in this province where transcontinental automobile and railway roads end. It also has Canada's largest ports on the Pacific coast, through which international trade is conducted. Thanks to the warm and mild climate and considering the fact that less than five percent of the province's land is used for arable land, agriculture is still very developed there</p>
                                            <p>This is especially true of Okanagan Valley and Fraser. Tourism and various kinds of outdoor recreational activities are well developed, but the main source for income in the province's budget is still mining and logging.</p>

                                            <p>Okanagan region is known as one of the wine regions of Canada and in addition to excellent wine, is engaged in the production of cider. The Cowichan Valley, which is located on Vancouver Island and the Fraser Valley, also produce wine. The warmest and longest summer in all of Canada is in Penticton and Kamloops, as well as in the countryside in the Oliver district.</p>

                                            <p>Most of the island of Vancouver, as well as the rest of the coast of the province, is covered with boreal forests. Territories located in the interior of the continent not affected by the ocean, cover semi-arid plateaus and deserts. The northern latitudes of British Columbia are characterized by a rather cold climate. Two-thirds of the province in the north are undeveloped and uninhabited. They are almost completely covered by mountains.</p>

                                            <p>British Columbia is a good place to find a job in Canada. Unemployment rates in the province have dropped in comparison to the past 30 years, falling at 6.1%. Many of these new jobs are in the service or technology sectors. With growth forecasts very positive for the future of the province, there will continue to be many job opportunities for immigrants in British Columbia in the near future.

                                            <p>British Columbia is one of the most appealing places to settle in Canada. In addition to its abundance of natural beauty, there are many factors that make B.C. a great place to live, work and raise a family.
