                                			<p>For most jobs, completion of a secondary school in Quebec is needed. If you speak good French and English, it significantly increases your chances of finding an employment. Especially, a decent knowledge of the written language is in high demand in the professional job market.</p>
                                            <p>Some professions and trades are regulated. This means you need to meet various conditions to practice them. More information on the regulated occupation can be obtained from the relevant regulatory body to obtain the necessary information.</p>
                                            <p>Québec offers good opportunities for self-employed work that includes full-time, part-time, temporary and contract work. Many workers are engaged in small and medium businesses. The best period for securing an interview with your future employer is summer, when most employees are on vacation. </p>
                                            <p>Québec companies are committed to equality, cooperation, flexibility and participation. Québec managers value proactive participation; direct communication and constructive comments are expected from employees.
                                            <p>Equal opportunity is a very important value in Québec. You will be treated as any other Quebecer. Despite your high qualifications, if you are new in Quebec without any job experience, you’ll be expected first to prove yourself by working in a less qualified position for a certain period of time. </p>
                                            <p>In Québec, the conditions under a job contract have greater power than the relationship you may establish with your employer. Even if you have a conflict with your employer, the contract will govern the final resolution of the dispute. Managers usually try to find consensus and resolve conflict through negotiation and compromise. </p>
                                            <p>Québec employers value employees who complete their projects in due time. Work meetings generally follow a specific agenda to ensure that discussions are structured and that the meeting’s objectives are met.</p>
                                            <p>Hiring and promotion in Quebec generally depends on skills, accomplishments and individual employee performance. The individual’s ability to successfully adapt to the work team is also very important. </p>  
                                            <p>Women are very well represented in the Québec job market. They are actively engaged in the professions or trades of their choice. They work in a variety of fields and are involved at every level of the business hierarchy.</p>

                                            <p>The Évaluation comparative des études effectuées hors du Québec (Comparative evaluation for studies done outside Québec) is a professional opinion issued by the Ministère de l'Immigration, de la Diversité et de l'Inclusion for reference purposes only. It is neither a diploma nor an equivalency diploma.</p>
                                            <p>This evaluation compares two official education systems indicating the educational standards areas of training that can be used to compare credentials done abroad.</p>
                                            <p>Many regulatory bodies and companies use it in their admission and employment process. For example, to access jobs in Québec’s public service, the comparative evaluation is considered on the same basis as diplomas obtained in Québec.</p>
                                            <p>You can submit a comparative assessment form even from abroad.

                                            <p>Some trades and professions in Quebec are regulated, for example, the engineering and nursing professions. Regulatory bodies protect the public, have the authority to establish admission terms and practice standards, assess skills and diplomas, and issue a certificate or permit to qualified candidates.</p>
                                            <p>Other trades and professions also fall under the regulatory requirements, for instance, electricians, crane operators and gas workers form trades that are regulated by other regulatory bodies. Similarly, certain occupations and disciplines in the financial sector, the teaching profession, and the heavy vehicle driver trade is regulated. </p>
                                            <p>Check to see whether the trade or profession that you want to practice in Québec is governed by a regulatory body or subject to regulatory requirements. This will give you an understanding of the conditions you need to work in your occupation in Québec and the actions you should take in order to submit your file to the organization. This preparation will accelerate your integration into the job market.</p>
                                            <p>Certain steps leading to obtaining the right to practice a regulated profession or trade can be taken from your country of residence prior to your departure for Québec. </p>
                                            <p>We can help you contact the regulatory body responsible for the profession you plan to practice in Québec as soon as possible.</p>

                                            <p>If you received points in the selection grid because you have a diploma in the occupation that is in demand in Québec, then you should visit Labor Market Information (LMI) to search more about the field of activity you intend to work and the best job prospects in your field. </p>
                                            <p>Job search requires efforts and an efficient strategy. This is why it is so important that you start the necessary preparations before your arrival in Quebec.
