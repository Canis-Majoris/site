                                			<p>Quebec selects business immigrants who wish to settle in its territory. Only applicants who can significantly contribute to the local economy will be selected for permanent residency. So candidates have to meet the eligibility criteria one of the three business immigration programs: Entrepreneur, Investor or Self-Employed Worker and submit an application for permanent residence. During the application evaluation process, applicants may be invited to a selection interview in Montréal. Eligible applicants will receive a Quebec Selection Certificate, an official immigration document issued by the Government of Quebec.</p>
                                            <p>The Government of Canada accepts to Quebec only those business applicants that have been chosen by the province.</p>
                                            <p>The Entrepreneur Program encourages approved applicants to come to Quebec on a temporary basis to launch their business project as soon as possible. Therefore, eligible applicants have to submit an application for temporary residence simultaneously as they apply for permanent residence.</p>
                                            <p>In addition, applicants and their family members must pass the required medical examination and security screenings.</p>
                                            <p>Applications for permanent residence will be turned down if the applicant’s health or of a family member represents a risk to public health or safety or is likely to be an excessive burden on health or social services in Canada, even if the applicant has received a Quebec Selection Certificate.</p>
                                            <p>Foreigners receive permanent resident status when they arrive in Canada. Permanent residents have the same rights as Canadian citizens, besides the right to vote. After three years of living in Canada, permanent residents can apply for Canadian citizenship.
